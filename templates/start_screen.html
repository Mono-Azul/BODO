<h1>Hello, Friends of BODO!</h1>
<p>BODO is a useful app to explore batch data from the famous process control system Botec of Krones.
    Please note that BODO ist not produced, endorsed or otherwise linked to Botec and it's owner!
    All data is retrieved from the public interface database called Iface. Only read access to this DB is necessary.</p>
<p>BODO is useful as it is, but nevertheless also a demonstrator for possible further data visualisation.
    If you are interested in more and better insights into your data, please get in contact to the manufacturer of BODE:
    Mono Azul. You can find us here www.mono-azul.de</a></p>
